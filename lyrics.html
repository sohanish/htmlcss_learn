    <h1>The lyrics of all time low </h1>
    <p>
    I was the knight in shining armour in your movie <br>
    Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste <br>
    Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me <br>
    You're the reason that I just can't concentrate <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    I, I've been trying to fix my pride <br>
    But that shit's broken, ooh, that shit's broken <br>
    Ooh, lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide <br>
    But now you know it <br>
    That I'm at an all time <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low <br>
    </p>

    I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD
    An example of the perfect candidate
    Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
    You're the reason that I just can't concentrate
    I, I've been trying to fix my pride
    But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
    Now I lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide
    But now you know it
    That I'm at an all time
